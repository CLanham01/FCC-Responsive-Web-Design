                    <p>Much is unclear of the timing of His birth. All that is curtain is what was written in the
                        gospels.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Although many have and yet still do misrepresent His name and do evil acts in His name, His
                        <strong>true </strong>
                        character is described in the Gospels and the rest of the New Testament of the Bible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>His character is <strong>LOVE!</strong></li>

                    <p>"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall

                        Word (Jesus) became flesh and while being 100% God and 100% Man Jesus lived a perfectly
                        righteous
                        life as an example to all what living with the Holy Spirit is like.</p>

                    <p>Though being innocent of any wrongdoing, He was taken and suffered and was crucified in place of
                        all
                        mankind’s sins.</p>
